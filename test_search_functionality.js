To test search functionality manually, open http://localhost:8080 and:

1. Navigate to different pages with search UI
2. Try these search queries:
   - "getting started" (should find getting-started page)
   - "tailwind" (should find build-related content)
   - "CLI reference" (should find command documentation)
   - "pagefind" (should find search-related content)
   - "garp serve" (should find server documentation)

3. Verify search results display properly with:
   - Highlighted search terms
   - Page titles as clickable links
   - Relevant excerpts
   - Quick response time (< 500ms)

4. Test on different screen sizes:
   - Mobile (< 640px width)
   - Tablet (640px - 1024px width)  
   - Desktop (> 1024px width)

5. Test error scenarios:
   - Search with no results
   - Very long search queries
   - Special characters in search

Expected behavior:
✓ Search input should be styled consistently
✓ Results should appear as you type
✓ Clicking results should navigate to correct pages
✓ Search should work on all pages
✓ No JavaScript errors in console
✓ Search UI should be responsive

Test pages:
- http://localhost:8080/docs/ (main docs)
- http://localhost:8080/docs/getting-started.html
- http://localhost:8080/docs/cli-reference.html  
- http://localhost:8080/blog/first-post.html
- http://localhost:8080/test.html
