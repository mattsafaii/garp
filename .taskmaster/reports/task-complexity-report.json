			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create CLI Tool Framework and Basic Command Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CLI framework creation into: 1) Language selection and project setup with dependency management, 2) Command parsing library integration and basic command structure, 3) Help system and version display implementation, 4) Error handling and input validation framework",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to architectural decisions, command parsing library integration, and establishing patterns for the entire CLI. Foundation task that affects all subsequent development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Scaffolding (garp init)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide scaffolding into: 1) Directory structure creation and validation, 2) Template file generation with embedded templates, 3) Configuration file creation (.env, Caddyfile, build scripts) with proper defaults",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving file system operations, template management, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Straightforward implementation but requires attention to detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Caddy Server with Basic Markdown Rendering",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Caddyfile configuration for static file serving, 2) Goldmark template integration and markdown parsing, 3) URL routing implementation for markdown files, 4) Error handling and MIME type configuration",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to Caddy configuration intricacies, template system integration, and routing logic. Requires understanding of Caddy's template system and Goldmark parser."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Development Server (garp serve)",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Caddy server startup and configuration management, 2) Port configuration and host binding options, 3) Signal handling for graceful shutdown and error reporting",
			"reasoning": "Lower-medium complexity as it primarily wraps Caddy server functionality. Main challenges are process management and configuration handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Unified Build Command (garp build)",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Build orchestration and script execution, 2) Progress feedback and error reporting system, 3) Selective building flags and dependency validation",
			"reasoning": "Lower-medium complexity as it orchestrates existing build scripts. Main focus is on process coordination, user feedback, and error handling."

			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Git-based deployment strategy implementation, 2) Rsync and server deployment methods, 3) Static hosting platform integrations (Netlify, Vercel), 4) Pre-deployment build automation and validation, 5) Rollback mechanisms and deployment configuration management",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple deployment strategies, external service integrations, and need for robust error handling and rollback capabilities. Requires extensive testing across different deployment scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Add Comprehensive Error Handling and Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) CLI command error handling and user-friendly messaging, 2) Input validation framework and dependency checking, 3) Project structure and configuration validation, 4) Error logging and exit code standardization",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity as it touches all parts of the system and requires consistent error handling patterns. Critical for user experience and system reliability."
